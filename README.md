# simpleSingleCell results

This repository contains compiled Markdown files for the [simpleSingleCell](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/html/simpleSingleCell.html) workflow.
Each file represents the compiled version of one of the vignettes.
The aim is to allow the maintainers to easily diagnose changes to the workflow results upon updates to dependent packages.
